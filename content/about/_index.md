I am a graduate student in the University of Iowa's Computer Science department
and am advised by [Professor Suely Oliveira](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~oliveira/).
My research interests are primarily focused on machine learning and large-scale
distributed computing. Specifically, I am interested in building scalable
machine learning systems.

Outside of research I am also interested in security and am a contibutor in the Firefox and
Rust communities.
